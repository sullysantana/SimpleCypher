# SimpleCypher
A project I made to play around with accessing code from the CLI with arguments.
The program can encode text and text from local test files from command prompt
...
make sure something is written inside the inputfile
...
input into the CLI has to look something like this: 
"python SimpleCy.py -i inputfile.txt -o outputfile.txt -e -r 4"
